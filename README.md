# octave-osstesm


## General information

Osstesm is a personal [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave)
project. I started this project to explore the
[OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) capabilities
of Octave, which I didn't use at all in
[Atomm](https://github.com/thierr26/octave_atomm).
